This asset requires two other free assets to operate as shown in CanisterOfPride_image.png.
Please import these before importing LP_CanisterOfPride.unitypackage.

1) Free asset from Unity Asset Store
    "Animated Match 3 Gems + Hue Shift Sprites Shaders"
    This asset provides a hugh shifting shader that was used to recolor the "hearts" sprite sheet.

 
2) Poiyomi Toon Shader
    https://github.com/poiyomi/PoiyomiToonShader
    Poiyomi Shader was used to add glitter to the end caps of the canister.

Thank You,
